First, here is a new one-page handout specifically for the phone class. It covers the absolute basics for both iPhone and Android, drawing from the content in your app. This can be your "cheat sheet" as well as your students'.

Your Quick Guide to Smartphones (iPhone & Android)
Welcome! Your phone is a powerful computer that fits in your pocket. This guide will help you understand the basics of the two most popular types of smartphones.

iPhone vs. Android (The Two Big Teams)
While there are many brands of phones, they mostly fall into two main categories.

iPhone (Made by Apple): Apple makes both the phone (the hardware) and the operating system that runs on it (iOS). Think of it like a car company that builds both the car and its specific engine.

Android (System by Google, Phones by Many): Google makes the Android operating system, but many different companies use it to build their phones (like Samsung, Google Pixel, Motorola, etc.). Think of it like a popular engine that many different car brands use in their models. Your Samsung Galaxy is an Android phone.

Navigating Your Phone (The Basic Gestures)
Most modern phones don't have buttons on the front anymore. Hereâ€™s how you get around.

Action	iPhone (with Face ID)	Android (Modern Gestures)
Go Home	Swipe up from the bottom edge.	Swipe up from the bottom edge.
See Open Apps	Swipe up from the bottom and pause.	Swipe up from the bottom and hold.
Go Back	Swipe from the left edge of the screen.	Swipe from the left or right edge.
Quick Settings	Swipe down from the top-right corner (for Control Center: Wi-Fi, brightness, etc.).	Swipe down from the top edge (for Quick Settings: Wi-Fi, flashlight, etc.).
Getting New Apps
On an iPhone, you use the App Store.
On an Android phone, you use the Google Play Store.
Two Essential Tips for Any Phone
Improve Battery Life: Your screen is the biggest battery drain. Go into your phone's Settings > Display and lower the brightness. Using Wi-Fi instead of mobile data (4G/5G) also saves a lot of power.

Take a Screenshot:

iPhone: Quickly press and release the Side Button and the Volume Up button at the same time.
Android (most phones): Quickly press and release the Power Button and the Volume Down button at the same time.
You've got this! Learning your device is the first step to making technology work for you.

How to Approach Teaching This
Now, let's apply the principles from your classPresentationTips.txt to this new topic.

The "Hook": Start with a relatable phone problem.

"Have you ever felt like your phone is smarter than you are? Or maybe you've tried to help a friend or family member with their phone, only to realize it's completely different from your own? Today, we're going to demystify the two biggest players in the smartphone world: iPhone and Android. By the end of this, you'll feel more confident using whichever one you have in your pocket."
Use Analogies: The "car and engine" analogy for iPhone vs. Android is very effective. It immediately clarifies why there's one iPhone but many kinds of Androids.

Be Interactive: This is even easier with phones than with PCs.

"Okay, let's get our phones out. Who here has an iPhone? Raise your hand. Great! Who has an Android? Awesome."
"Let's all try to take a screenshot right now. iPhone users, press Side and Volume Up. Android users, Power and Volume Down. Did it work?" This creates a small, immediate "win" for them.
"Now let's all try to turn on our flashlight from the quick settings." Guide both groups through it.
Your own experience of learning your Galaxy A15 is actually your greatest teaching asset here. Be open about it! It makes you more relatable. You can say, "I'm a PC guy, and I've been learning my own Android phone right along with preparing for this. Let's figure some of this out together." That framing takes all the pressure off and turns it into a shared journey.
