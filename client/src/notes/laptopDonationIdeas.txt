Ideas for Sourcing Donated Laptops

---

Since you're volunteering as an individual, the approach is a bit different than for a registered non-profit, but you still have some great options. Here are a few avenues you can explore, from most likely to least likely to succeed for an individual.

### 1. The Hyper-Local Approach (Your Best Bet)

This is all about leveraging your local community. People are often very willing to help a local cause, especially when they can see the direct impact.

*   **Local Computer Repair Shops:** These are gold mines. They often have older, traded-in laptops that are perfectly usable but not worth much for resale. Go in and tell your story. Ask if they have any older Windows 7 or 10 laptops they'd be willing to donate.
*   **Community Social Media:** Post a heartfelt request on platforms like **Nextdoor** or a local **Facebook Community Group** (like a town forum or a "Buy Nothing" group). A personal story is powerful.
    > *"Hi neighbors, I'm a volunteer teaching basic computer and job skills at our local recovery center. I'm looking for any old, unused laptops you might have collecting dust. Even an older machine that can just browse the internet would make a huge difference in helping someone get back on their feet. I'm happy to pick them up! Thank you."*
*   **Local Businesses & Offices:** Think about small to medium-sized businesses in your area (law offices, accounting firms, real estate agencies). They often upgrade their computers every 3-5 years. A polite phone call or a well-written letter explaining your mission can sometimes yield a few machines.

### 2. Partnering with the Recovery Center

Even though you are a volunteer, the recovery center itself might be a registered non-profit (like a 501(c)(3)). If so, that opens up many more doors.

*   **Talk to the Center's Director:** Ask if they would be willing to officially request donations. You can do all the legwork, but having the request come from the organization makes it official and allows businesses to write off the donation.
*   **National Refurbishers:** With the center's non-profit status, you can apply to national programs. Check out organizations like:
    *   **PCs for People:** They provide low-cost computers to eligible individuals and non-profits.
    *   **The National Cristina Foundation:** They connect companies that have old tech with non-profits that need it.
    *   **InterConnection:** Another great organization focused on providing technology to underserved communities.

### 3. Other Avenues to Explore

*   **E-Waste and Recycling Events:** Check with your local city or county government to see if they have e-waste recycling events. Contact the company running the event and ask if they have a donation or refurbishment program.
*   **University Surplus Departments:** If there's a college or university nearby, they have a department that gets rid of old equipment. It's often sold for very cheap, but sometimes they are willing to donate to community causes.

Your passion for this project is the most powerful tool you have. People are more likely to give to a person with a clear, heartfelt mission than to a faceless request. You're doing amazing work.
