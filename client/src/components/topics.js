      <p>A computer is an electronic device that takes in information (input), stores it, processes it according to instructions (a program), and provides results (output). It manipulates data at high speeds and can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from basic calculations to complex scientific simulations. The fundamental actions of any computer are inputting data, manipulating or processing it, storing it, and recalling or outputting the results</p>
      <h3>Hardware & Software</h3>
      <p>Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hardware</b> refers to the tangible, physical parts of a computer system that you can see and touch, such as the monitor, keyboard, central processing unit (CPU), and hard drive. Unlike software, which are intangible programs and instructions, hardware is the physical machinery that enables a computer system to operate. Examples include internal components like memory modules and integrated circuits, as well as external devices like speakers, printers, and network equipment like routers and switches.</li>
        <li><b>Software</b> is a collection of intangible computer programs, instructions, and data that tell a computer's physical hardware what to do and how to do it. It enables electronic devices to perform specific tasks, acting as the link between human-understandable commands and the binary code the hardware processes. Software is divided into two main types: system software, which manages the computer's hardware and operations (like operating systems), and application software, which allows users to perform specific tasks (like word processors or games).</li>
        <li><b>History</b> The history of the computer began with ancient calculation tools like the abacus and astrolabe, progressing to early mechanical calculators in the 17th century, and the concept of the programmable Analytical Engine by Charles Babbage in the 19th century. The 20th century saw the development of the first electronic computers, such as Konrad Zuse's Z3 (1941), the ENIAC (1946), and the introduction of the transistor in the late 1940s. The advent of integrated circuits and microprocessors in the 1970s led to smaller, more powerful personal computers, with major milestones including the first microprocessor (Intel 4004, 1971), the first home computer (Altair 8800, 1975), and the introduction of the graphical user interface (Macintosh, 1984).</li>

    title: 'Basic Parts of a Computer',
    content: `
      <p>Understanding the basic parts of a computer is the first step to becoming a confident user. This guide will introduce you to the essential hardware components of a standard desktop computer and explain their functions.</p>
      
      <h3>1. The Monitor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The monitor is the screen that displays visual information, such as text, images, and videos, generated by the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It serves as the primary output device, allowing you to see and interact with the operating system and software applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The Computer Case (or Tower)</h3>
      <p>The case is the enclosure that houses and protects the main internal components of the computer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instructions and performs the calculations necessary for the computer to function.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> This is the main circuit board that connects all the components, allowing them to communicate with each other.</li>
        <li><strong>RAM (Random-Access Memory):</strong> RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can run smoothly at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage (Hard Drive):</strong> This is the computer's long-term memory. It stores your files, documents, applications, and the operating system. There are two main types: the traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and the newer, faster Solid-State Drive (SSD).</li>
        <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):</strong> The GPU, or graphics card, is responsible for rendering images and video for display on the monitor.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> The PSU converts electrical power from an outlet into the correct voltage for the computer's internal components.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Keyboard</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The keyboard is the primary input device for typing text and entering commands.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Groups:</strong> Keyboards are organized into several groups, including the main typing keys (QWERTY), function keys (F1-F12), navigation keys (arrow keys, Home, End), and a numeric keypad.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Mouse</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The mouse is a handheld pointing device that allows you to interact with items on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> By moving the mouse, you control the cursor on the screen to point, click, and select files, icons, and menus. Most mice also have a scroll wheel for easy navigation of documents and web pages.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These four components—the monitor, case, keyboard, and mouse—are the fundamental building blocks of a desktop computer system. Understanding the role of each part is essential for effective use and troubleshooting.</p>

        <li>The part after the dot in a filename tells Windows what type of file it is.</li>
        <li><strong>.docx</strong> = Word Document</li>
        <li><strong>.jpg</strong> = Image</li>
        <li><strong>.mp3</strong> = Audio</li>
        <li><strong>.exe</strong> = Program</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Turn on extensions for clarity: In File Explorer → View → Show → File name extensions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Cool Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shift + Right-Click a File:</strong> “Copy as Path” (perfect for sending exact file locations).</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + Z:</strong> Undo last file action (like accidental delete or rename).</li>
        <li><strong>Alt + Enter:</strong> View file/folder properties instantly (size, location, permissions).</li>
        <li><strong>Windows Key + V:</strong> Opens Clipboard History (copy/paste multiple things).</li>
      </ul>

    title: 'Understanding Computer Specs (CPU, RAM, Storage)',
    content: `
      <p>When you look at a new computer, you'll see terms like CPU, RAM, and Storage. Understanding what these mean can help you choose the right device for your needs.</p>
      
      <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
      <p>The CPU is the "brain" of the computer. It performs all the calculations and executes the commands that make your computer work. A faster CPU means your computer can think and perform tasks more quickly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cores:</strong> Modern CPUs have multiple "cores," which are like individual brains. More cores allow the computer to work on multiple tasks at once without slowing down.</li>
        <li><strong>Clock Speed (GHz):</strong> Measured in gigahertz (GHz), this tells you how many operations a single core can perform per second. A higher number is generally faster.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RAM (Random-Access Memory)</h3>
      <p>RAM is your computer's short-term memory. It's where the computer keeps the data for the programs and files you are actively using. Think of it like your desk space: the more RAM you have, the more things you can have open and work on at the same time without it getting cluttered and slow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capacity (GB):</strong> Measured in gigabytes (GB). For general use like browsing the web and email, 8GB is good. For more demanding tasks, 16GB or more is better.</li>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> RAM is volatile, which means its contents are erased when the computer is turned off.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)</h3>
      <p>Storage is your computer's long-term memory. It's where your files, photos, applications, and the operating system are saved permanently, even when the computer is off. Think of it like a filing cabinet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive):</strong> An older, mechanical drive. It's cheaper and offers more space, but it's slower.</li>
        <li><strong>SSD (Solid-State Drive):</strong> A newer type of drive with no moving parts. It's much faster, making your computer start up and open programs very quickly. Most modern computers use SSDs.</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p>If your computer is running slow, there are several simple things you can do to improve its performance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Close Unused Programs:</strong> Every program you have open uses RAM. Close any applications you're not actively using to free up resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Startup Programs:</strong> Many programs set themselves to start automatically when you turn on your computer. You can disable unnecessary startup programs through the Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) in Windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Up Disk Space:</strong> A nearly full hard drive can slow your computer down. Use the Disk Cleanup tool in Windows to remove temporary files, or manually delete files you no longer need.</li>
        <li><strong>Restart Your Computer:</strong> Restarting your computer clears out its temporary memory (RAM) and can resolve many performance issues. It's a good idea to restart it at least once every few days.</li>

      <p>Get more out of your smartphone's battery with these simple tips.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Screen Brightness:</strong> The screen is one of the biggest battery drains. Lowering the brightness or enabling "Auto-Brightness" can save a lot of power.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Wi-Fi When Possible:</strong> Connecting to Wi-Fi uses less battery than using mobile data (4G/5G).</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Background App Refresh:</strong> Stop apps from updating in the background. You can manage this in your phone's settings for each app individually.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Low Power Mode / Battery Saver:</strong> Both iPhone and Android have a mode that reduces background activity and other non-essential features to extend battery life when you're running low.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn off Unnecessary Notifications:</strong> Every notification that wakes up your screen uses a little bit of battery. Turn off notifications for apps that you don't need to hear from immediately.</li>

    content: `
      <p>Just like a car, your computer needs regular maintenance to run smoothly and last longer. These simple steps can help keep your PC in great shape.</p>

      <h3>1. Keep it Physically Clean</h3>
      <p>Dust is the enemy of electronics. It can clog fans and cause components to overheat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exterior:</strong> Once a month, wipe down the computer case, keyboard, and mouse with a dry or slightly damp cloth.</li>
        <li><strong>Vents:</strong> Ensure the air vents on the case are not blocked by walls or other objects. Good airflow is crucial for cooling.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Use a soft, microfiber cloth to gently wipe the screen. Avoid harsh chemicals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Run Software Updates</h3>
      <p>Updates are critical for security and performance. They patch security holes and often include performance improvements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows Update:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update</strong> and click "Check for updates". It's a good habit to do this at least once a month.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Software:</strong> Keep your web browser (like Chrome or Edge) and antivirus software up to date. They usually update automatically, but it's good to check.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Clean Up Your Hard Drive</h3>
      <p>A full hard drive can slow down your computer. Regularly cleaning out unnecessary files can help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disk Cleanup:</strong> Windows has a built-in tool called Disk Cleanup. Search for it in the Start Menu. It can safely remove temporary files and other junk.</li>
        <li><strong>Empty the Recycle Bin:</strong> Files you delete go to the Recycle Bin. Right-click the Recycle Bin on your desktop and select "Empty Recycle Bin" to permanently delete them and free up space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Protect Against Viruses</h3>
      <p>Malware can slow down your computer and compromise your security. Windows comes with a solid, free antivirus program called <strong>Windows Security</strong> (also known as Windows Defender).</p>
      <ul><li>Make sure it's running and run a "Full scan" periodically to check for any threats.</li></ul>

    title: "Staying Safe Online: A Beginner's Guide",
    content: `
      <p>The internet is a powerful tool, but it's important to be careful to protect your personal information. Following a few simple rules can keep you safe from common threats.</p>

      <h3>1. Create Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
      <p>A strong password is your first line of defense.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use simple words like "password123" or personal information like your birthday.</li>
        <li>A good password is long (at least 12 characters) and mixes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !@#$).</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Think of a short, memorable sentence and use the first letter of each word, adding numbers and symbols. For example, "My first dog was a beagle!" could become <strong>M1dwab!</strong>.</li>
        <li>Try to use a different password for each important account, especially your email and online banking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Watch Out for Phishing Scams</h3>
      <p>Phishing is when criminals try to trick you into giving them your information. They often do this through fake emails, texts, or website links.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be suspicious of messages that create a sense of urgency, like "Your account will be locked!" or "You've won a prize!".</li>
        <li>Never click on links or download attachments from senders you don't recognize.</li>
        <li>If an email looks like it's from your bank, don't click the link. Instead, open your web browser and type in your bank's website address yourself.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Be Careful What You Download</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only download software from official websites or trusted sources like the Microsoft Store.</li>
        <li>"Free" software from unknown sites can sometimes contain viruses or other malicious programs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Be Smart on Public Wi-Fi</h3>
      <p>Public Wi-Fi (like at a coffee shop or airport) is not always secure. It's best to avoid doing sensitive things like online banking or entering passwords when connected to a public network.</p>

      <h3>5. Real-World Example: Spotting a Fake Shopping Website</h3>
      <p>You might see an online ad for a product at a price that seems too good to be true (like a $2,000 bike for $50). This is a major red flag. Here’s how to investigate before you buy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Domain Age:</strong> Scammers create new websites constantly. Use a free "WHOIS lookup" tool online (like whois.com) to check the website's "Creation Date". If the site is only a few weeks or months old, it is almost certainly a scam.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Contact Information:</strong> A real business will have a physical address and a customer service phone number. A scam site might only have a generic email address or a simple contact form.</li>
        <li><strong>Examine Payment Options:</strong> Legitimate stores offer standard payment methods like credit cards and PayPal. If a site pushes you to use non-reversible methods like Zelle, Cash App, or a wire transfer, it is a scam.</li>
        <li><strong>Search for External Reviews:</strong> Don't trust reviews on the site itself. Search Google for "[Website Name] reviews" or "[Website Name] scam". The absence of any reviews for a supposed business is a very bad sign.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trust your instincts! If a deal feels too good to be true, it almost always is.</p>

    title: 'Email Basics: Your Guide to Digital Mail',
    content: `
      <p>Email (electronic mail) is a fundamental tool for communication in today's world. It's how you can apply for jobs, stay in touch with family, and manage online accounts. This guide covers the absolute essentials.</p>

      <h3>1. What is an Email Address?</h3>
      <p>An email address has two main parts, separated by the "@" symbol: <strong>username@provider.com</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Username:</strong> The unique name you choose (e.g., <code>john.smith123</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Provider:</strong> The company that provides the email service (e.g., <code>gmail.com</code>, <code>outlook.com</code>, <code>yahoo.com</code>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Composing a New Email</h3>
      <p>When you click "Compose" or "New Email," you'll see a few fields:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To:</strong> The email address of the person you are sending the message to.</li>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> A brief, clear title for your email. <strong>Never leave this blank!</strong> A good subject helps the recipient know what the email is about.</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> The main area where you type your full message.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Replying and Attachments</h3>
      <ul><li><strong>Reply:</strong> Sends your response only to the person who sent you the original email. Be careful with "Reply All," which sends to everyone on the email.</li><li><strong>Attachments:</strong> Look for a paperclip icon (📎) to attach files like a resume or a photo to your email.</li></ul>

    title: 'Managing User Accounts in Windows',
    content: `
      <p>User accounts in Windows help keep your files and settings separate from others who use the same computer. They also play a crucial role in security. This guide explains the different types of accounts and how to manage them.</p>

      <h3>1. Administrator vs. Standard User: What's the Difference?</h3>
      <p>Windows has two main types of user accounts, each with different levels of permission.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Administrator Account:</strong> Think of this as the "owner" or "master" account. An administrator has full control over the computer. They can install any software, change any system setting, access all files, and create or delete other user accounts. The first account created on a new PC is usually an administrator account.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard User Account:</strong> This account is for everyday use. A standard user can run applications, browse the internet, and change their own personal settings (like their desktop wallpaper). However, they cannot install most new programs or make major changes that affect the whole system without providing the administrator's password.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Using a Standard account for daily tasks is much safer. If you accidentally click on something malicious, it has a much harder time damaging the core system files because it doesn't have administrator permissions.</p>

      <h3>2. How to Add a New User Account</h3>
      <p>It's a great idea to create separate standard accounts for other family members or users.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> (the gear icon in the Start Menu).</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Family & other users</strong> from the side menu.</li>
        <li>Under "Other users," click <strong>Add someone else to this PC</strong>.</li>
        <li>Windows will encourage you to use a Microsoft account. For a simple local account, click <strong>"I don't have this person's sign-in information"</strong> and on the next screen, click <strong>"Add a user without a Microsoft account."</strong></li>
        <li>Enter a username for the new account, and set a password. It's a good idea to add password hints in case they forget.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The new account will be created as a Standard User by default, which is perfect for most situations.</p>

      <h3>3. Managing Your Account Settings</h3>
      <p>In <strong>Settings > Accounts</strong>, you can manage your own settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your info:</strong> You can change your account picture here.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign-in options:</strong> This is where you can change your password or set up other sign-in methods like a PIN.</li>
      </ul>

    id: 'web-browsing-basics',
    category: 'internet-connectivity',
    title: 'Introduction to Web Browsing',
    content: `
      <p>A web browser is your gateway to the internet. It's the application you use to visit websites, search for information, and watch videos. This guide will cover the fundamental skills you need to navigate the web confidently.</p>

      <h3>1. What is a Web Browser?</h3>
      <p>A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Common examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> (the most popular)</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> (built into Windows)</li>
        <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>They all do the same basic job: they get you to websites.</p>

      <h3>2. The Address Bar: Your Digital GPS</h3>
      <p>The long bar at the very top of the browser is the address bar. This is where you type the address of a website, also known as a <strong>URL</strong> (Uniform Resource Locator).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A URL often starts with <code>www.</code> and ends with something like <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, or <code>.gov</code>. For example: <code>www.google.com</code>.</li>
        <li>You can also use the address bar to search. Just type what you're looking for (e.g., "weather today") and press Enter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Using Tabs to Multitask</h3>
      <p>Tabs allow you to have multiple web pages open in a single browser window. This is great for comparing information or keeping your email open while you browse other sites.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for a small <strong>plus sign (+)</strong> at the top of the browser to open a new tab.</li>
        <li>You can switch between open pages by clicking on their tabs.</li>
        <li>To close a tab, click the small 'x' on the tab itself.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Bookmarks: Saving Your Favorites</h3>
      <p>If you find a website you want to visit again, you can save it as a bookmark (or "favorite"). Look for a <strong>star icon (☆)</strong> in the address bar. Clicking it will save the current page to a list you can easily access later.</p>

      <h3>5. A Quick Safety Tip: Look for the Lock</h3>
      <p>When you are on a website where you might enter sensitive information (like a password or credit card number), look for a small <strong>padlock icon (🔒)</strong> in the address bar. This means your connection to the site is encrypted and more secure.</p>

    title: 'Connecting to Wi-Fi & Understanding Mobile Data',
    content: `
      <p>Getting online is one of the most important things you can do with your computer or phone. This guide explains the two main ways to connect: Wi-Fi and Mobile Data.</p>

      <h3>1. What is Wi-Fi?</h3>
      <p>Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that provides internet access over a short distance, typically inside a building like your home, a library, or a coffee shop. It uses a device called a <strong>router</strong> to create a wireless network.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally fast, stable, and doesn't use your phone's data plan. Ideal for large downloads, streaming video, and general browsing at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited range. You must be physically near the router to connect.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What is Mobile Data (4G/5G)?</h3>
      <p>Mobile data is internet access provided by your cell phone company. It allows you to get online almost anywhere you have a cell signal.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Very convenient; works on the go.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> It uses your phone's data plan, which can be limited and may cost money if you go over your allowance. It can also be slower than Wi-Fi and drain your phone's battery faster.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> When you're at home or in a trusted place with a network, always try to use Wi-Fi to save your mobile data and battery.</p>

      <h3>3. How to Connect to Wi-Fi</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On a Windows PC:</strong> Click the network icon (looks like a globe or Wi-Fi symbol) in the bottom-right corner of the taskbar. A list of available networks will appear. Click the one you want to connect to, enter the password if required, and click "Connect".</li>
        <li><strong>On a Phone (iPhone & Android):</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and tap on <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>. Your phone will scan for nearby networks. Tap the name of the network you want to join and enter the password.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A Note on Security: Public vs. Private Wi-Fi</h3>
      <p>Your home Wi-Fi is a <strong>private</strong> network, protected by a password. Wi-Fi at a public place like an airport or coffee shop is a <strong>public</strong> network. Be cautious on public Wi-Fi—it's best to avoid logging into sensitive accounts like your bank, as these networks can be less secure.</p>

    title: "Antivirus & Firewalls: Your PC's Bodyguards",
    content: `
      <p>When you connect to the internet, your computer is exposed to the outside world. Antivirus software and firewalls are two essential tools that work together to protect your computer from threats.</p>

      <h3>1. What is Antivirus Software?</h3>
      <p>Think of antivirus software as a security guard for your computer. Its job is to detect, block, and remove malicious software (often called "malware") like viruses, spyware, and ransomware.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It actively scans files you download, websites you visit, and programs you run to look for known threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Good News:</strong> Windows comes with a powerful, free antivirus program called <strong>Windows Security</strong> (also known as Windows Defender). For most users, this is all you need!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What is a Firewall?</h3>
      <p>If antivirus is the security guard, the firewall is the locked front door. A firewall monitors the traffic coming into and going out of your computer over the internet. It acts as a barrier, blocking unauthorized access attempts from hackers and malicious software.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It helps prevent outsiders from gaining access to your computer without your permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Good News:</strong> Windows also has a built-in firewall that is turned on by default. You can find it by searching for "Windows Defender Firewall" in the Start Menu.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Do You Need Both? Yes!</h3>
      <p>They perform two different but equally important jobs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Firewall</strong> stops unwanted visitors from getting to your door.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Antivirus</strong> deals with any troublemakers that manage to get inside.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> The most important thing you can do is ensure that Windows Security is turned on and that you allow it to update regularly. Combined with safe browsing habits (like not clicking on suspicious links), this provides excellent protection for your computer.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Zoom is a popular application used for video meetings, online classes, and webinars. This guide will walk you through the basics of joining a meeting and using the main controls.</p>
      
      <h3>1. The Live Chat Link</h3>
      <p>Our weekly live tech support chat uses the following link. This link is the same every week!</p>
      <p><strong><a href="${zoomConfig.link}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">${zoomConfig.link}</a></strong></p>

      <h3>2. Joining a Zoom Meeting</h3>
      <p>The easiest way to join a meeting is by clicking a link provided by the host (the person running the meeting), like the one above.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the Zoom link you received in an email or on a website.</li>
        <li>Your web browser will open. It may ask for permission to open the Zoom application. Click "Open" or "Allow". If you don't have Zoom installed, it will guide you to download it.</li>
        <li>You may be placed in a "Waiting Room." This is normal. The host will let you into the meeting shortly.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. The Main Controls (The Control Bar)</h3>
      <p>Once you're in the meeting, you'll see a bar with several icons, usually at the bottom of the screen. If you don't see it, move your mouse.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mute / Unmute (Microphone Icon 🎤):</strong> This is the most important button! Click it to turn your microphone on or off. A red line through the icon means you are muted and no one can hear you.</li>
        <li><strong>Start / Stop Video (Video Camera Icon 📹):</strong> Click this to turn your camera on or off. A red line through it means your camera is off.</li>
        <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Click this to see a list of everyone who is in the meeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat:</strong> Opens a text chat window where you can type messages to everyone or to a specific person.</li>
        <li><strong>Leave:</strong> When you are ready to leave the meeting, click this red button.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Using a Virtual Background</h3>
      <p>A virtual background allows you to display an image or video as your background during a meeting, which is great for privacy or just for fun.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the control bar, click the small upward arrow (^) next to the <strong>Start/Stop Video</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Choose Virtual Background...</strong> from the menu.</li>
        <li>A settings window will open. You can choose one of Zoom's default images, or click the plus sign (+) to upload your own photo.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature works best with a solid-colored wall behind you and good lighting.</p>

      <h3>5. Fancy Tips & Tricks (The Secrets)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Touch Up My Appearance:</strong> Zoom has a built-in filter that can help smooth out your appearance on camera. In the video settings (click the arrow next to the video icon), check the box for "Touch up my appearance."</li>
        <li><strong>Mute/Unmute with the Spacebar:</strong> If you are muted, you can press and hold the spacebar to temporarily unmute yourself to speak. When you let go, you'll be muted again. It's like a walkie-talkie button for Zoom.</li>
        <li><strong>Gallery View vs. Speaker View:</strong> In the top-right corner of the Zoom window, you can switch between "Speaker View" (which shows the person currently talking) and "Gallery View" (which shows everyone in a grid).</li>
        <li><strong>Reactions:</strong> You can use the "Reactions" button in the control bar to give a thumbs-up (👍) or clap (👏) without interrupting the speaker.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Basic Meeting Etiquette</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mute Yourself:</strong> It's good practice to keep your microphone muted unless you are speaking. This prevents background noise from disrupting the meeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Aware of Your Background:</strong> When your camera is on, be mindful of what others can see behind you.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Don't be afraid to click around! The Mute and Video buttons are your best friends. Mastering them will make you a confident Zoom user.</p>

    title: 'Advanced Android Features',
    content: `
      <p>You've mastered the basics of your Android phone, but there's a world of powerful features hidden just beneath the surface. While the exact steps can vary slightly between manufacturers like Samsung, Google Pixel, or Motorola, these concepts are available on most modern Android devices and can truly enhance your experience.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Supercharge Your Home Screen with Widgets</h3>
      <p>Beyond just app icons, widgets display live, interactive information directly on your home screen. You can have a weather widget, a calendar showing your next appointment, or music controls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to add:</strong> Long-press on an empty space on your home screen and tap 'Widgets'. Browse the list and drag your chosen widget to the screen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Master Multitasking with Split-Screen Mode</h3>
      <p>Need to watch a video while replying to a text? Split-screen mode lets you run two apps side-by-side.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to use:</strong> Open your recent apps screen (usually by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and holding). Tap the icon of the first app you want to use and select 'Split screen' or 'Open in split screen view'. Then, select the second app from the list.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Unlock Developer Options for a Snappier Feel</h3>
      <p>This is a hidden menu with advanced settings. One of the safest and most popular tweaks is to speed up animations, which makes your phone feel much faster.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Enable Developer Options:</strong> Go to Settings > About phone. Find the 'Build number' and tap it 7 times in a row. You'll see a message saying "You are now a developer!".</li>
        <li><strong>Change Animation Speed:</strong> Go back to the main Settings menu, find the new 'Developer options' menu (it might be under 'System'). Scroll down to the 'Drawing' section and find 'Window animation scale', 'Transition animation scale', and 'Animator duration scale'. Changing these from 1x to 0.5x will make animations twice as fast.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful in Developer Options, as changing other settings can have unintended effects. It's best to only change the animation scales unless you know what you're doing.</p>

      <h3>4. Take Control with Notification Channels</h3>
      <p>Tired of getting certain types of notifications from an app, but not others? Android lets you control this with 'Notification Channels'.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to use:</strong> Long-press on a notification as it comes in. You might see an option to 'Turn off notifications' for that specific category (or channel). You can also go to Settings > Apps > [Select an App] > Notifications to see all available channels and toggle them on or off.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Find the Hidden Android "Easter Egg" Game</h3>
      <p>As a fun tradition, Google includes a hidden interactive screen or mini-game, known as an "Easter Egg," in every version of Android. It's a fun little secret to show your friends!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to find it:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings > About phone > Android version</strong>. On this screen, tap the "Android version" number several times in a row.</li>
        <li><strong>What happens next:</strong> A special screen will appear, often with the logo of your Android version (like Android 13 or 14). If you interact with this screen (tap and hold, for example), it will often launch a simple, hidden game. The game is different for almost every version of Android!</li>
      </ul>

    title: "Using Your Phone's Digital Wallet (Apple & Google Pay)",
    content: `
      <p>One of the most convenient features of a modern smartphone is its digital wallet. This allows you to make secure payments in stores with just a tap of your phone, and can even store things like boarding passes, event tickets, and loyalty cards.</p>
      
      <h3>What is a Digital Wallet?</h3>
      <p>A digital wallet is an app on your phone that securely stores digital versions of your credit and debit cards. The two most common are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Wallet (with Apple Pay):</strong> This is built into every iPhone.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Wallet (with Google Pay):</strong> This is the standard for Android phones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you use your phone to pay, it uses a technology called <strong>NFC (Near Field Communication)</strong> to talk to the store's card reader.</p>

      <h3>How to Set It Up</h3>
      <p>Setting up your wallet is a one-time process. You'll open the Wallet app on your phone and follow the prompts to add a card. This usually involves using your phone's camera to scan your physical credit or debit card.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>Wallet</strong> app on your iPhone or Android.</li>
        <li>Tap the 'Add' or '+' button to add a new card.</li>
        <li>Follow your bank's instructions to verify the card. This might involve a text message or a quick call.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How to Use It in a Store</h3>
      <p>Once set up, using it is simple and fast:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Look for the contactless payment symbol (looks like a Wi-Fi symbol turned on its side) at the checkout counter.</li>
        <li><strong>On iPhone:</strong> Double-press the side button (or Home button on older models) to bring up your default card. Authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.</li>
        <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Simply unlock your phone. You don't usually need to open the app.</li>
        <li>Hold the top of your phone near the card reader for a moment. You'll see a checkmark and feel a vibration when the payment is complete.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Is It Secure?</h3>
      <p>Yes, it's actually more secure than using your physical card. Here's why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> When you add your card, the wallet creates a unique, encrypted virtual card number (a "token"). Your real card number is never stored on your phone and is never shared with the merchant.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Every payment requires you to authenticate with your face, fingerprint, or passcode. If your phone is stolen, no one can use your wallet without unlocking it first.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using your phone's digital wallet is a secure, convenient way to handle everyday payments.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Your Android home screen is the first thing you see when you unlock your phone. You can make it look and work the way you want by changing wallpapers, adding widgets, organizing apps, and more.</p>

      <h3>1. Change Your Wallpaper</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your home screen.</li>
        <li>Long-press (tap and hold) on an empty space.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Wallpaper & Style</strong> (the exact name may differ depending on your phone brand).</li>
        <li>Choose from preloaded wallpapers, a photo from your Gallery, or other options.</li>
        <li>Select if you want it applied to the Home Screen, Lock Screen, or Both.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. Add Widgets (Quick Information on Your Screen)</h3>
      <p>Widgets let you see useful information without opening an app.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Long-press on an empty space on your home screen.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Widgets</strong>.</li>
        <li>Browse the list (Clock, Weather, Calendar, etc.).</li>
        <li>Tap and hold a widget, then drag it onto your home screen. You can often resize it by holding its edges.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Add and Organize Apps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the App Drawer (usually by swiping up from the bottom).</li>
        <li>Find the app you want, then tap and hold it to drag it to your home screen.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>To create a folder:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Drag one app icon on top of another. A folder will be created automatically.</li>
        <li>Tap the folder to open it, then tap its name to rename it.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Customize the Dock (Bottom Row of Apps)</h3>
      <p>The dock is the row of apps that stays visible on all home screens.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To remove an app, long-press it and drag it out of the dock.</li>
        <li>To add an app, drag it from your home screen into an empty spot in the dock.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Change Navigation Style (Buttons or Gestures)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Display → Navigation Bar</strong> (the name may vary).</li>
        <li>Choose between <strong>3-button navigation</strong> (Back, Home, Recent Apps) or <strong>Gesture navigation</strong> (swiping).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>6. Customize the Lock Screen</h3>
      <p>In <strong>Settings → Lock Screen</strong>, you can often change the wallpaper, add app shortcuts (like Camera or Flashlight), and customize the clock style.</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Experiment step by step. Start with wallpaper, then try widgets, then folders. Customization should make your phone easier to use—not harder.</p>

    title: 'A Deep Dive into Notification Settings on Android',
    content: `
      <p>Notifications are alerts from your apps that appear on your lock screen, home screen, or status bar. They keep you updated, but too many can be distracting. Android lets you control how and when notifications appear.</p>

      <h3>1. Open Notification Settings</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unlock your phone and swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification shade.</li>
        <li>Tap the gear icon (⚙️) to open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Notifications</strong> (may also be under <strong>Apps & Notifications</strong> depending on your phone).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. Manage Notifications for Individual Apps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In Settings → Notifications, select <strong>App Notifications</strong>.</li>
        <li>Scroll and tap on an app you want to manage.</li>
        <li>You can turn all notifications for that app On or Off. Many apps also allow finer control over different types of alerts (like messages vs. promotional alerts).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Adjust Lock Screen Notifications</h3>
      <p>In <strong>Settings → Notifications → Lock screen notifications</strong> (wording may differ), you can choose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Show all notification content:</strong> Everything is visible on the lock screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Hide sensitive content:</strong> You'll see which app sent a notification, but the message content is hidden until you unlock your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t show notifications at all:</strong> Keeps your lock screen completely private.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Quick Settings for Notifications</h3>
      <p>When a notification arrives, you can manage it directly:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Swipe down to see your notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Tap and hold</strong> a notification to see options.</li>
        <li>You can often choose to make notifications from that app <strong>Silent</strong> (they appear but don't make noise or vibrate) or turn them off completely.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</h3>
      <p>This mode blocks most notifications so you can focus. In <strong>Settings → Notifications → Do Not Disturb</strong>, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose what gets through (e.g., calls from favorite contacts, alarms).</li>
        <li>Schedule DND to turn on and off automatically (e.g., from 10 PM to 7 AM daily).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Notification History</h3>
      <p>Some newer Android versions let you see notifications you recently dismissed. In <strong>Settings → Notifications → Notification history</strong>, you can turn this feature on. It's very useful if you accidentally swipe away an important alert.</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Start by customizing your most-used apps (like Messages, Email, Social Media). That way, you only get alerts that matter most to you.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Google Assistant is a virtual helper built into Android devices. You can use your voice or text to ask questions, control your phone, manage tasks, and even control smart devices.</p>

      <h3>1. How to Open Google Assistant</h3>
      <p>There are a few ways depending on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Say “Hey Google” or “Ok Google.”</li>
        <li><strong>Button:</strong> On some phones, press and hold the Home button or the Power button.</li>
        <li><strong>Swipe:</strong> On newer Android versions, swipe diagonally from a bottom corner of the screen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Basic Everyday Commands</h3>
      <p>Try saying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What’s the weather today?”</li>
        <li>“Set a timer for 10 minutes.”</li>
        <li>“Wake me up at 7 AM.”</li>
        <li>“Call [Contact Name].”</li>
        <li>“Send a text to [Contact Name].”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Managing Your Day</h3>
      <p>Google Assistant can act as your daily organizer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What’s on my calendar today?”</li>
        <li>“Remind me to drink water at 3 PM.”</li>
        <li>“Add milk to my shopping list.”</li>
        <li>“How’s the traffic to [Destination]?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Controlling Your Phone with Voice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Open [App Name].”</li>
        <li>“Turn on Bluetooth.”</li>
        <li>“Take a selfie.”</li>
        <li>“Increase brightness.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Custom Routines</h3>
      <p>You can create routines so one command does many things at once. In the Google Home app, you can set a trigger phrase like “Good morning” to perform a series of actions like telling you the weather, playing the news, and turning on your smart lights.</p>

      <h3>6. Using Google Assistant Without Speaking</h3>
      <p>If you can’t or don’t want to talk out loud, just open Google Assistant and type your request in the text box. You’ll get the same results as speaking.</p>
      
      <br>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Try practicing 5–10 commands daily (alarms, weather, reminders, searches). Within a week, you’ll remember them naturally.</p>

  {
    id: 'android-app-permissions',
    category: 'tips-tricks',
    title: 'Understanding and Managing App Permissions',
    content: `
      <p>Every app you install on your Android phone may ask for permission to use certain features, such as the camera, microphone, or location. Learning how to manage these permissions helps protect your privacy and ensures apps only access what they truly need.</p>

      <h3>1. What Are App Permissions?</h3>
      <p>App permissions are requests from apps to use parts of your phone. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> For taking pictures or videos.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> For voice messages or calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> For maps or delivery apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> To connect with people you know.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage/Files:</strong> To save or open files.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When an app first needs a permission, it will ask you to allow or deny it.</p>

      <h3>2. How to View and Change Permissions for an App</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Apps</strong> (or Apps & Notifications).</li>
        <li>Select the app you want to check, then tap <strong>Permissions</strong>.</li>
        <li>You’ll see which permissions are allowed and denied. Tap on any permission to change it.</li>
        <li>You can typically choose: <strong>Allow only while using the app</strong> (recommended), <strong>Ask every time</strong>, or <strong>Don’t allow</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Managing Permissions by Category</h3>
      <p>Instead of checking app by app, you can see all apps that use a specific feature:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Privacy → Permission Manager</strong> (the name may vary).</li>
        <li>Choose a category, like <strong>Location</strong> or <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>
        <li>You will see a list of which apps have access. You can change permissions for any app from this list.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Why Permission Management Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Some apps may ask for data they don’t need (for example, a calculator asking for your location).</li>
        <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Apps that constantly use GPS or the microphone can drain your phone's power.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Limiting permissions reduces the risk of apps misusing your data if they are ever compromised.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Special Permissions</h3>
      <p>Some permissions are more powerful and require extra caution. You might see these in a "Special app access" menu in your settings. Only grant these if you fully trust the app.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Install unknown apps:</strong> Allows an app to install other apps from outside the Google Play Store.</li>
        <li><strong>Display over other apps:</strong> Allows an app to draw on top of other apps (like chat bubbles).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <br>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Only grant permissions that make sense for the app’s purpose. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A map app needs <strong>Location</strong>, but not necessarily <strong>Contacts</strong>.</li>
        <li>A music app needs <strong>Storage</strong> (for songs), but not your <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p>Google Photos is a cloud-based app that helps you store, organize, and share photos and videos. It also offers editing tools and automatic backups, so your memories stay safe and accessible from any device.</p>

      <h3>1. Backing Up Your Photos</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Google Photos app and sign in with your Google Account.</li>
        <li>Tap your profile picture (top right).</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Photos settings → Backup</strong>.</li>
        <li>Turn on <strong>Backup</strong>. Your photos and videos will now be saved to your Google account.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. Organizing Photos</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Albums:</strong> Group related photos together (e.g., vacation, school events). In the app, go to <strong>Library → Albums</strong> to create new ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Tap the ⭐ icon on any photo to mark it as a favorite for easy access.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Use the search bar to find photos by people (faces are grouped automatically), places, or even objects in the photo (e.g., “dog,” “pizza”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Editing Photos</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a photo and tap <strong>Edit</strong> (looks like sliders).</li>
        <li>Use tools like <strong>Filters</strong>, <strong>Adjust</strong> (for brightness/contrast), and <strong>Crop & Rotate</strong>.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Save copy</strong> to keep the original and the edited version.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Sharing Photos and Albums</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Select one or more photos and tap the <strong>Share</strong> icon.</li>
        <li>You can send a link, share directly to apps like WhatsApp or Gmail, or create a <strong>Shared Album</strong> for group events so everyone can add their photos.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Freeing Up Space on Your Device</h3>
      <p>Once your photos are backed up, you can safely remove them from your phone's local storage to save space.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In Google Photos, tap your profile picture → <strong>Free up space</strong>.</li>
        <li>The app will delete photos and videos from your device that are already safely stored in the cloud. You will still be able to see them in the Google Photos app.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>6. Recovering Deleted Photos</h3>
      <p>Deleted photos go to the Trash/Bin and stay there for 30-60 days before being permanently deleted. To restore a photo, go to <strong>Library → Trash</strong>, select the photo, and tap <strong>Restore</strong>.</p>

      <h3>7. Storage Management</h3>
      <p>Your Google Account comes with 15 GB of free storage, which is shared between Google Photos, Gmail, and Google Drive. If you need more, you can purchase a Google One plan for additional space.</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Turn on Backup right away. This is the most important step to ensure your photos are safe even if your phone is lost, stolen, or damaged.</p>

      <h3>1. What Can Extensions Do?</h3>
      <p>Extensions can modify the way you experience the web. Some popular categories include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ad Blockers:</strong> Block intrusive ads and pop-ups for a cleaner browsing experience (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdGuard).</li>
        <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Securely store your passwords and automatically fill them in on websites (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password).</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping Tools:</strong> Automatically find coupon codes or compare prices when you shop online (e.g., Honey, Rakuten).</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity Tools:</strong> Check your grammar, save articles to read later, or take notes (e.g., Grammarly, Pocket).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. How to Find and Install Extensions (Using Chrome Web Store)</h3>
      <p>For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, you get extensions from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your browser and go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Web Store</a>.</li>
        <li>Use the search bar to find an extension by name or category.</li>
        <li>Click on the extension you want to learn more about. Read the description and reviews to make sure it's reputable.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>"Add to Chrome"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>A pop-up will appear asking for permissions. Review them, and if you agree, click <strong>"Add extension"</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. How to Manage Your Extensions</h3>
      <p>Once installed, your extensions can be managed from the toolbar.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Puzzle Piece Icon:</strong> Click the puzzle piece icon (🧩) in the top-right corner of your browser to see a list of all your installed extensions.</li>
        <li><strong>Pinning an Extension:</strong> Click the pin icon (📌) next to an extension in the list to keep its icon visible on the toolbar for quick access.</li>
        <li><strong>Disabling or Removing:</strong> Click the three dots (⋮) next to an extension in the puzzle piece menu, then select "Remove from Chrome" to uninstall it, or use the toggle switch to temporarily disable it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>⚠️ A Word of Caution:</strong> Be selective about the extensions you install. Only use extensions from reputable developers, as they require permission to access data from the websites you visit. Too many extensions can also slow down your browser.</p>

    title: 'Understanding Cloud Storage (OneDrive & Google Drive)',
    content: `
      <p>You've learned how to manage files on your computer, but what if you could access those same files from your phone or any other computer in the world? That's the power of cloud storage.</p>

      <h3>1. What is Cloud Storage?</h3>
      <p>Think of cloud storage as a magic folder on your computer. Anything you put in this folder is not only saved on your PC, but also automatically copied to a secure, private location on the internet. It's like having a personal hard drive that follows you everywhere.</p>
      <p>The two most common services are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microsoft OneDrive:</strong> This is built directly into Windows and is connected to your Microsoft account.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> This comes with every Google account and works great on the web and with a desktop app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The Three Superpowers of Cloud Storage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Syncing:</strong> "Syncing" is short for synchronizing. If you change a file in your cloud folder on your PC, the new version automatically appears on your phone. It keeps everything up-to-date across all your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Because your files are also stored online, they are safe even if your computer is lost, stolen, or broken. It's an automatic backup for your most important files.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> You can easily share a file (or even an entire folder) with someone else by sending them a special link. This is much easier than trying to email large files.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. How to Use It (with OneDrive in Windows)</h3>
      <p>Using cloud storage is designed to be simple.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li>
        <li>Look for the <strong>OneDrive</strong> folder in the navigation pane on the left. It often has a blue cloud icon.</li>
        <li>Simply drag and drop files into this folder just like any other folder on your computer. That's it! The files will automatically upload and sync.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You may see different icons next to your files. A cloud icon means the file is stored online to save space, and a green checkmark means a copy is also saved on your computer for offline access.</p>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Start small. Drag a few non-critical documents or photos into your OneDrive or Google Drive folder. Then, try accessing them from your phone's OneDrive or Drive app. Seeing it work is the best way to understand its power.</p>

    id: 'two-factor-auth',
    category: 'advanced-pc',
    title: 'Securing Your Accounts with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)',
    content: `
      <p>You've learned how to create strong passwords, but in today's world, sometimes even a great password isn't enough. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is one of the most powerful ways to protect your online accounts from unauthorized access.</p>

      <h3>1. What is Two-Factor Authentication?</h3>
      <p>Think of it like needing two keys to open a very important door. Your password is the first key. The second "key" (or factor) is something only you have access to, usually a temporary code generated on your phone.</p>
      <p>Even if a criminal steals your password, they can't log in to your account because they don't have your phone to get the second key. It's a simple concept that dramatically increases your security.</p>

      <h3>2. Common Types of 2FA</h3>
      <p>When you enable 2FA on a website (like your email or bank), it will usually ask you to choose a method for your second factor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SMS (Text Message) Codes:</strong> The service texts a code to your phone number. This is good, but considered the least secure method of 2FA.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticator Apps (Recommended):</strong> You use a special app on your phone (like <strong>Google Authenticator</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Authenticator</strong>) that generates a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds. This is much more secure than SMS.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Security Keys:</strong> A small USB device (like a YubiKey) that you plug into your computer to prove it's you. This is the most secure method available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Why It's a "Level Up" Skill</h3>
      <p>Using 2FA is what separates basic users from security-conscious power users. It shows you understand that security is about layers. Protecting your digital life is one of the most important skills you can learn, and 2FA is the cornerstone of that protection.</p>

      <h3>4. How to Get Started</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick an Authenticator App:</strong> Download Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator from your phone's app store.</li>
        <li><strong>Go to Your Most Important Account:</strong> Start with your primary email account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). This is the key to your entire digital life.</li>
        <li><strong>Find the Security Settings:</strong> Log in to your email on a computer. Look for the "Security" or "Sign-in & Security" section in your account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable 2FA/2-Step Verification:</strong> Look for an option called "2-Step Verification" or "Two-Factor Authentication" and turn it on. Follow the on-screen instructions to link it to your authenticator app by scanning a QR code.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Enable 2FA on your main email account first. Then, enable it on your online banking and any major social media accounts. This single step will make you a much harder target for online criminals.</p>

    title: 'Unlock "God Mode": A Hidden Windows Feature',
    content: `
      <p>There is a well-known "secret" in Windows called "God Mode." It's not a game or a special operating mode, but rather a hidden feature that creates a special folder containing a master list of almost every setting and control panel option available in Windows.</p>

      <h3>Why is it Useful?</h3>
      <p>Windows settings are spread across the modern Settings app and the classic Control Panel. "God Mode" brings them all into one convenient, searchable list. It's a favorite trick of IT professionals and power users who need to access deep system settings quickly without digging through menus.</p>

      <h3>How to Enable "God Mode"</h3>
      <p>Enabling it is simple and completely safe. You are just creating a special shortcut folder.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your Desktop.</li>
        <li><strong>Right-click</strong> on an empty space, go to <strong>New</strong>, and select <strong>Folder</strong>.</li>
        <li>A new folder will appear. You need to rename it to the following exact text (it's best to copy and paste it):</li>
        <li><code>GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}</code></li>
        <li>Press Enter. The folder's icon will change to look like a Control Panel icon.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's it! Double-click the new icon to open a window with a huge, organized list of settings, from changing your account picture to formatting a hard drive.</p>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> While you may not need to use this every day, knowing how to create this folder is a great "power user" trick to have up your sleeve. It's a perfect example of how much control you can have over your computer once you know the secrets.</p>

    title: 'Introduction to HTML',
    content: `
      <p>HTML, which stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. Think of it as the skeleton that gives a website its structure.</p>

      <h3>1. What are HTML Tags and Elements?</h3>
      <p>HTML uses "tags" to define different types of content. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An <strong>opening tag</strong> looks like this: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (for a paragraph).</li>
        <li>A <strong>closing tag</strong> looks like this: <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> (note the forward slash).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The content that goes between the opening and closing tags, along with the tags themselves, is called an <strong>HTML element</strong>.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph element.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>2. A Basic HTML Document Structure</h3>
      <p>Every HTML document has a standard structure that tells the browser it's a web page.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- Your page content goes here --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: Declares that this is an HTML5 document.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code>: The root element of the page.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>: Contains meta-information about the page, like the title. This content is not displayed on the page itself.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>: The title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: Contains all the visible content of the page, like headings, paragraphs, and images.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Common HTML Tags</h3>
      <p>Here are some of the most common tags you'll use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>: Headings, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most important.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: Paragraphs of text.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code>: Links. The <code>href</code> attribute specifies the link's destination. Example: <code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Go to Google&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code>: Images. This is a self-closing tag and requires a <code>src</code> (source) attribute for the image URL and an <code>alt</code> (alternative text) attribute for accessibility. Example: <code>&lt;img src="photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset"&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>: Unordered (bulleted) lists. Each list item is wrapped in an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>: Ordered (numbered) lists.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>: Makes text bold to indicate importance.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code>: Makes text italic to add emphasis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Putting It All Together</h3>
      <p>Here is a complete example of a simple HTML page. You could save this as <code>index.html</code> and open it in a web browser.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my very first paragraph. I can make text &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a link to a great resource: &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"&gt;MDN HTML Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> The best way to learn HTML is by doing. Try creating your own <code>.html</code> file in a simple text editor like Notepad and experiment with changing the tags and content.</p>
    `

  {
    id: 'intro-to-css',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Introduction to CSS',
    content: `
      <p>If HTML is the skeleton of a web page, then CSS (<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>) is the clothing. CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document—it describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</p>

      <h3>1. How to Add CSS to a Page</h3>
      <p>There are three ways to include CSS, but the best and most common way is using an <strong>external stylesheet</strong>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new file and save it with a <code>.css</code> extension (e.g., <code>style.css</code>).</li>
        <li>In your HTML file, add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section to connect to your stylesheet:</li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>2. Basic CSS Syntax</h3>
      <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
      <pre><code>selector {
  property: value;
}</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>selector</strong> points to the HTML element you want to style (e.g., <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code>).</li>
        <li>The <strong>declaration block</strong> contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</li>
        <li>Each declaration includes a CSS <strong>property</strong> name and a <strong>value</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Common Selectors</h3>
      <p>Selectors are how you "find" or select the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Element Selector:</strong> Selects elements based on the element name. (e.g., <code>p</code> selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements).</li>
        <li><strong>Class Selector:</strong> Selects elements with a specific class attribute. It starts with a period (.). (e.g., <code>.intro</code> selects <code>&lt;p class="intro"&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>ID Selector:</strong> Selects an element with a specific id attribute. It starts with a hash (#). An ID should be unique on a page. (e.g., <code>#firstname</code> selects <code>&lt;p id="firstname"&gt;</code>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Common CSS Properties</h3>
      <p>Here are a few basic properties to get you started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>color</code>: Sets the color of text.</li>
        <li><code>background-color</code>: Sets the background color of an element.</li>
        <li><code>font-size</code>: Sets the size of a font.</li>
        <li><code>font-family</code>: Specifies the font for an element (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman).</li>
        <li><code>border</code>: A shorthand property for setting the border width, style, and color.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Putting It All Together</h3>
      <p>Let's style the simple HTML page from the previous guide. Create a file named <code>style.css</code> in the same folder as your HTML file with the following content:</p>
      <pre><code>body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333366; /* A dark blue color */
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: #555;
  line-height: 1.5;
}</code></pre>
      <p>When you open your HTML file in the browser, you should now see your styles applied!</p>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> CSS is all about experimenting. Change the values, try new properties, and see what happens. The browser's developer tools (usually opened with F12) are your best friend for inspecting and debugging CSS.</p>

    id: 'intro-to-javascript',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Introduction to JavaScript',
    content: `
      <p>If HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the clothing, then JavaScript is the brain and muscles that bring a web page to life. It's a programming language that allows you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.</p>

      <h3>1. What Can JavaScript Do?</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is the language of interactivity on the web. You can use it to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show or hide information with the click of a button.</li>
        <li>Change the color of an element when the mouse hovers over it.</li>
        <li>Display timers or a countdown.</li>
        <li>Validate data in a form before it gets sent to a server.</li>
        <li>Create complex animations and games.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. How to Add JavaScript to a Page</h3>
      <p>Just like CSS, the best way to add JavaScript is with an <strong>external file</strong>. This keeps your code organized.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new file and save it with a <code>.js</code> extension (e.g., <code>script.js</code>).</li>
        <li>In your HTML file, add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>  &lt;!-- Your page content goes here --&gt;
  &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Why at the end?</strong> Placing the script at the end of the body ensures that the HTML content has loaded before the JavaScript tries to interact with it.</p>

      <h3>3. Core Concepts for Beginners</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> A variable is a container for storing a value. You declare one using the <code>let</code> keyword.
          <pre><code>let message = "Hello, world!";</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It's executed when "invoked" or called.
          <pre><code>function greet() {
  alert("Hello there!");
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Events are actions that happen on a web page, like a user clicking a button. We can make our JavaScript code "listen" for these events. Common events are <code>onclick</code>, <code>onmouseover</code>, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> The DOM (Document Object Model) is the browser's representation of your HTML page. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to find, change, add, or delete HTML elements. The most common way to find an element is with <code>document.getElementById()</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Putting It All Together: A Simple Example</h3>
      <p>Let's make a button that changes the text of a heading.</p>
      <p><strong>index.html:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;JS Demo&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1 id="greeting"&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button onclick="changeText()"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><strong>script.js:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>function changeText() {
  // Find the h1 element by its ID
  const heading = document.getElementById("greeting");
  
  // Change its text content
  heading.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
}</code></pre>
      <p>When you open <code>index.html</code> and click the button, the <code>changeText()</code> function in <code>script.js</code> will run and update the heading.</p>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Your browser's developer tools (F12) are essential for JavaScript. The "Console" tab will show you errors in your code and lets you experiment with JavaScript commands live.</p>

  {
    id: 'html-document-structure',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'HTML Document Structure in Depth',
    content: `
      <p>Every HTML page has a standard structure that acts as its foundation. Understanding this structure is the first step to creating well-formed web pages.</p>

      <h3>1. The Document Type Declaration: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>This is always the very first line of an HTML document. It's not an HTML tag itself, but an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tells the browser to use the modern HTML5 standard.</p>

      <h3>2. The Root Element: <code>&lt;html&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag wraps all the content on the entire page. It's often called the "root" element because it's the parent of everything else.</p>

      <h3>3. The Head: <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for metadata (data about the data). The information inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is not displayed on the page itself, but it's very important for the browser.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></strong>: This defines the title of your document, which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. It's also very important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></strong>: This tag provides metadata about the HTML document.
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring text is displayed correctly.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code> makes the website responsive, meaning it will look good on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and phones.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></strong>: This tag is used to link to external resources, most commonly a CSS stylesheet. Example: <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;script&gt;</code></strong>: This tag is used to embed or refer to an executable script, usually JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Body: <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element contains all the visible content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, and lists. Everything you see in the main browser window is inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

      <h4>Example Structure:</h4>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

    id: 'html-text-tags',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Common HTML Tags for Text',
    content: `
      <p>HTML provides a wide variety of tags for structuring and formatting text content on a web page.</p>

      <h3>Headings: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>Headings are used to define the hierarchy of your content. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the most important heading (usually the main title of the page), and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the least important. Search engines use headings to understand the structure of your content.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Major Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Sub-section&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>Paragraphs: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used to define a paragraph of text. Browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after each paragraph.</p>

      <h3>Emphasis and Importance: <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>These are "semantic" tags, meaning they tell the browser about the *meaning* of the text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></strong>: Defines text with strong importance. It typically renders as <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></strong>: Defines emphasized text. It typically renders as <em>italic</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You might also see <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold) and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic). These are older, non-semantic tags. It's better to use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> because they provide more meaning to screen readers and search engines.</p>

      <h3>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></strong>: Inserts a single line break. This is an "empty" tag, which means it has no closing tag. Use it sparingly, for things like poems or addresses.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code></strong>: Creates a horizontal rule, which is a thematic break in the content (like a scene change). It's also an empty tag.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Blockquotes: <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag is used to define a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent this content.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a quote from another source. It is indented to show that it is special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>

    title: 'Creating Lists in HTML',
    content: `
      <p>HTML offers several ways to create lists, which are perfect for organizing information.</p>

      <h3>Unordered Lists: <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>An unordered list starts with the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag. Each list item starts with the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag. The list items will be marked with bullets by default.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>Ordered Lists: <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>An ordered list starts with the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag. Each list item also starts with the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>Nested Lists</h3>
      <p>You can place one list inside another list item to create a nested list.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fruit
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bananas&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;

    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Links and Images in HTML',
    content: `
      <p>Links and images are fundamental components that make the web interactive and visual.</p>

      <h3>Hyperlinks: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute is <code>href</code>, which indicates the link's destination.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>href</code></strong>: The URL of the page the link goes to.</li>
        <li><strong><code>target="_blank"</code></strong>: This attribute tells the browser to open the link in a new tab.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Visit Google&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="about.html" target="_blank"&gt;About Us (in a new tab)&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>Images: <code>&lt;img&gt;</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. It is an "empty" tag, meaning it has no closing tag. It has two required attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>src</code></strong>: Specifies the path to the image.</li>
        <li><strong><code>alt</code></strong>: Provides alternative text for the image. This text is crucial for accessibility, as it is read aloud to users with screen readers. It also displays if the image fails to load.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also specify the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the image.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="images/my-photo.jpg" alt="A photo of me on vacation" width="500" height="300"&gt;</code></pre>
    `
  },
  {
    id: 'html-tables',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'HTML Tables',
    content: `
      <p>HTML tables are used to display data in a structured, tabular format.</p>

      <h3>Basic Table Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></strong>: The wrapper for the entire table.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code></strong>: Defines a table row.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;td&gt;</code></strong>: Defines a table data cell.</li>
        <li><strong><code>&lt;th&gt;</code></strong>: Defines a table header cell. Text in a <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> is typically bold and centered.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre><code>&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;First Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Last Name&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><em>(Note: The <code>border="1"</code> attribute is used here for demonstration. Styling tables is best done with CSS.)</em></p>

  {
    id: 'css-selectors',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'CSS Selectors in Depth',
    content: `
      <p>Selectors are the foundation of CSS. They are patterns that "select" the HTML elements you want to style. Understanding the main types of selectors is key to controlling the appearance of your website.</p>

      <h3>1. Element Selector</h3>
      <p>This is the most basic selector. It selects all elements of a given type on the page.</p>
      <pre><code>/* Selects all paragraphs */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Selects all level 2 headings */
h2 {
  font-size: 24px;
}</code></pre>

      <h3>2. Class Selector</h3>
      <p>The class selector is the most common and useful selector. It selects all elements that have a specific <code>class</code> attribute. In your CSS, you denote a class with a period (<code>.</code>) followed by the class name.</p>
      <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>&lt;p class="highlight"&gt;This paragraph will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;This div will also be highlighted.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}</code></pre>
      <p>The power of classes is that you can apply the same class to many different elements.</p>

      <h3>3. ID Selector</h3>
      <p>The ID selector selects a single, unique element that has a specific <code>id</code> attribute. In CSS, you denote an ID with a hash symbol (<code>#</code>) followed by the ID name.</p>
      <p><strong>An ID must be unique on a page. You should only have one element with a given ID.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div id="main-header"&gt;This is the main header.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>#main-header {
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
}</code></pre>

      <h3>Combining Selectors</h3>
      <p>You can combine selectors to be more specific. For example, <code>div.highlight</code> will only select <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements that have the class "highlight", but not <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements with that class.</p>

    id: 'css-box-model',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'The Box Model: Margin, Border, Padding',
    content: `
      <p>In CSS, every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box. The "Box Model" is the set of rules that defines how this box is sized and how it interacts with other elements. It consists of four parts, from the outside in:</p>
      
      <div style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 20px; text-align: center; background-color: #f0f0f0;">
        <strong>Margin</strong> (transparent, outside the border)
        <div style="border: 2px dashed #00796b; padding: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
          <strong>Border</strong>
          <div style="background-color: #b2dfdb; padding: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <strong>Padding</strong> (transparent, inside the border)
            <div style="background-color: white; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-top: 20px;">
              <strong>Content</strong> (your text, images, etc.)
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>1. Content</h3>
      <p>The actual content of the box, where text and images appear. You set its size with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties.</p>

      <h3>2. Padding</h3>
      <p>Padding is the transparent space between the content and the border. It's like the matting around a picture in a frame. You can control it with properties like <code>padding</code>, <code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-left</code>, etc.</p>
      <pre><code>p {
  padding: 20px; /* 20px of padding on all four sides */
}</code></pre>

      <h3>3. Border</h3>
      <p>The border goes around the padding and content. It's the picture frame itself. You can set its width, style (solid, dashed, etc.), and color.</p>
      <pre><code>div {
  border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>

      <h3>4. Margin</h3>
      <p>Margin is the transparent space on the outside of the border. It's the space between this element and other elements around it. You can control it with properties like <code>margin</code>, <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, etc.</p>
      <pre><code>p {
  margin-top: 15px; /* Adds 15px of space above the paragraph */
}</code></pre>

    content: `
      <p>CSS has hundreds of properties, but you'll use a small handful of them most of the time. Here are some of the most common properties for styling text and backgrounds.</p>

      <h3>Text Styling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>color</code></strong>: Sets the color of the text.
          <pre><code>p { color: #333333; } /* A dark gray */</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>font-size</code></strong>: Sets the size of the text.
          <pre><code>h1 { font-size: 32px; }</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>font-family</code></strong>: Sets the typeface for the text. It's common to provide a list of "fallback" fonts.
          <pre><code>body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>font-weight</code></strong>: Sets how bold the text is. Can be a number (like 400 for normal, 700 for bold) or a keyword.
          <pre><code>strong { font-weight: bold; }</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>text-align</code></strong>: Aligns the text within its element.
          <pre><code>h1 { text-align: center; }</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Background and Spacing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>background-color</code></strong>: Sets the background color of an element.
          <pre><code>div { background-color: #f0f0f0; } /* A light gray */</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>width</code> / <code>height</code></strong>: Sets the dimensions of the element's content area.
          <pre><code>img { width: 100px; height: 100px; }</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>margin</code> / <code>padding</code></strong>: Controls the space outside (margin) and inside (padding) of an element's border.
          <pre><code>button { padding: 10px 20px; margin: 15px; }</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

  },
  {
    id: 'css-units',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Understanding CSS Units (px, em, rem, %)',
    content: `
      <p>When you set a size in CSS (like a <code>font-size</code> or <code>width</code>), you need to provide a unit. There are many units, but four are the most common.</p>

      <h3>Absolute Units: <code>px</code></h3>
      <p>A pixel (<code>px</code>) is an absolute unit. It's a single dot on the screen. <code>16px</code> will be the same size no matter what. Pixels are great for things you want to have a fixed size, like a border.</p>
      <pre><code>.box { border: 1px solid black; }</code></pre>

      <h3>Relative Units</h3>
      <p>Relative units are sized in relation to something else, which makes them very powerful for creating flexible and responsive designs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>%</code> (Percentage):</strong> A percentage is relative to the same property of the parent element. If a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is 500px wide, a child element with <code>width: 50%;</code> will be 250px wide.</li>
        <li><strong><code>em</code>:</strong> An <code>em</code> is relative to the font-size of the *current element*. If an element has <code>font-size: 16px;</code>, then <code>2em</code> is equal to 32px. If you change the element's font-size, the <code>em</code> value will change too.</li>
        <li><strong><code>rem</code> (Root em):</strong> A <code>rem</code> is relative to the font-size of the *root element* (the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag). This is very useful because you can change the font size of the entire website just by changing it on the root, and all <code>rem</code> units will scale proportionally. This is the most recommended unit for font sizes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> A good rule of thumb is to use <code>rem</code> for font sizes, <code>px</code> for borders, and <code>%</code> for layouts (like column widths).</p>

    title: 'JavaScript Variables and Data Types',
    content: `
      <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, we use keywords like <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code> to declare variables.</p>

      <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>let</code></strong>: Declares a block-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value. Its value can be changed.
          <pre><code>let age = 30;
age = 31; // This is allowed</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>const</code></strong>: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. Its value cannot be changed.
          <pre><code>const name = "John";
// name = "Jane"; // This would cause an error</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>var</code></strong>: The old way to declare variables. It has some tricky behavior (like function-scoping instead of block-scoping), so it's generally recommended to use <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common Data Types</h3>
      <p>JavaScript has several fundamental data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>String</strong>: A sequence of characters, written inside quotes.
          <pre><code>let greeting = "Hello, world!";</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Number</strong>: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
          <pre><code>let score = 100;
let temperature = 98.6;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Boolean</strong>: Can only have two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Often used for conditional logic.
          <pre><code>let isLoggedIn = true;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Array</strong>: A special variable that can hold more than one value, in an ordered list.
          <pre><code>let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: A collection of key/value pairs.
          <pre><code>let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>null</code></strong>: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
        <li><strong><code>undefined</code></strong>: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</li>
      </ul>

    title: 'JavaScript Functions and Events',
    content: `
      <p>Functions and events are the core of interactive web pages. Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called, while events are actions that happen in the browser.</p>

      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. You define a function using the <code>function</code> keyword.</p>
      <pre><code>// Defining the function
function showMessage() {
  alert("Hello, this is a message!");
}

// Calling the function
showMessage();</code></pre>
      <p>Functions can also take <strong>parameters</strong> (inputs) and <strong>return</strong> a value (output).</p>
      <pre><code>function add(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

let sum = add(5, 3); // sum is now 8</code></pre>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>Events are actions that occur on a web page, such as a user clicking a button, moving the mouse, or pressing a key. We can use JavaScript to "listen" for these events and run a function when they happen.</p>
      <p>The most common way to handle an event is with an HTML event attribute, like <code>onclick</code>.</p>
      
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>&lt;button id="myButton"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
      <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>// Find the button element
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Define the function to run on click
function handleClick() {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
}

// Attach the function to the button's click event
button.onclick = handleClick;</code></pre>
      <p>When the button is clicked, the <code>handleClick</code> function will be executed.</p>
      <p>Other common events include <code>onmouseover</code>, <code>onkeydown</code>, and <code>onload</code>.</p>

  {
    id: 'javascript-dom-intro',
    category: 'web-development',
    title: 'Introduction to the DOM',
    content: `
      <p>The <strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong> is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. When an HTML page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page.</p>

      <h3>The DOM as a Tree</h3>
      <p>The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree of objects (or "nodes"). The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag is the root, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> are its children, and so on.</p>

      <h3>Finding HTML Elements</h3>
      <p>JavaScript can access and manipulate these nodes. The most common ways to find an HTML element in the DOM are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>document.getElementById(id)</code></strong>: Finds an element by its unique ID.
          <pre><code>const mainHeader = document.getElementById("main-header");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>document.getElementsByTagName(name)</code></strong>: Finds all elements with a given tag name.
          <pre><code>const allParagraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>document.getElementsByClassName(name)</code></strong>: Finds all elements with a given class name.
          <pre><code>const allHighlights = document.getElementsByClassName("highlight");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>document.querySelector(selector)</code></strong>: Finds the <em>first</em> element that matches a specified CSS selector.
          <pre><code>const firstHighlight = document.querySelector(".highlight");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>document.querySelectorAll(selector)</code></strong>: Finds <em>all</em> elements that match a specified CSS selector.
          <pre><code>const allHighlights = document.querySelectorAll(".highlight");</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Changing HTML Content and Style</h3>
      <p>Once you have found an element, you can change its content or style.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>element.innerHTML</code></strong>: Changes the HTML content inside an element.
          <pre><code>mainHeader.innerHTML = "New, exciting header!";</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>element.style.property</code></strong>: Changes the CSS style of an element.
          <pre><code>mainHeader.style.color = "red";</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

    title: "Using the Browser's Developer Tools",
    content: `
      <p>Every modern web browser comes with a powerful suite of tools for web developers. These are called "Developer Tools" (or "DevTools"), and they allow you to inspect and debug a web page right in your browser.</p>

      <h3>1. How to Open the Developer Tools</h3>
      <p>There are a few easy ways to open them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Press F12:</strong> On most browsers on Windows, pressing the F12 key will open the DevTools.</li>
        <li><strong>Right-Click and Inspect:</strong> Right-click on any part of a web page and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. This will open the tools and highlight the element you clicked on.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcut:</strong> <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> (on Windows) or <code>Cmd+Option+I</code> (on Mac) is another common shortcut.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The Elements Tab</h3>
      <p>This is one of the most useful tabs. It shows you the page's HTML structure and the CSS that applies to each element.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can see the HTML in a tree view. As you hover over elements in the tree, they will be highlighted on the page.</li>
        <li>When you select an element, the "Styles" pane (usually on the right) shows you all the CSS rules being applied to it. You can even change the CSS values live in the browser to experiment with different styles!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Console Tab</h3>
      <p>The Console is your direct line of communication with the page's JavaScript.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viewing Logs:</strong> Developers use <code>console.log()</code> in their JavaScript code to print out messages, variables, and other information. This is incredibly helpful for debugging.</li>
        <li><strong>Seeing Errors:</strong> If there is an error in a page's JavaScript, the browser will report it here, often with a line number to help you find the problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Running Code:</strong> You can type JavaScript code directly into the console and press Enter to run it on the current page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Network Tab</h3>
      <p>The Network tab shows you all the files the browser had to download to display the page (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and images). It can help you diagnose slow-loading pages by showing you which files are taking the longest to load.</p>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> Don't be afraid to open the DevTools on any website and explore. It's a safe way to see how modern websites are built and to understand the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    title: 'How to Set Up a Wireless Printer',
    content: `
      <p>Setting up a wireless printer allows you to print from any computer, phone, or tablet on your Wi-Fi network without needing to plug in any cables. This guide will walk you through the general steps for setting up a modern wireless printer like an Epson or HP.</p>

      <h3>1. Before You Begin</h3>
      <p>Make sure you have the following ready:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Wi-Fi network name (also called SSID).</li>
        <li>Your Wi-Fi password.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Physical Setup</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unbox the printer:</strong> Remove all packing materials and tape from the inside and outside of the printer.</li>
        <li><strong>Plug it in:</strong> Connect the power cord to the printer and plug it into a wall outlet. Turn the printer on.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Ink/Toner:</strong> Follow the printer's on-screen instructions or setup guide to install the ink or toner cartridges.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Paper:</strong> Load plain paper into the paper tray.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Connect the Printer to Your Wi-Fi Network</h3>
      <p>This is the most important step. Your printer needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most new printers have a small touchscreen. Use it to navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>Network Setup</strong> menu.</li>
        <li>Look for a "Wireless Setup Wizard" or similar option.</li>
        <li>The printer will scan for available Wi-Fi networks. Select your network name from the list.</li>
        <li>Carefully enter your Wi-Fi password using the on-screen keyboard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once connected, the printer will usually display a confirmation message or a solid Wi-Fi light.</p>

      <h3>4. Add the Printer to Windows</h3>
      <p>Now, you need to tell your computer about the new printer.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>On your Windows computer, click the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and go to <strong>Settings</strong> (the gear icon).</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Bluetooth & devices</strong> from the side menu.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Printers & scanners</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Add device</strong> button. Windows will search your network for new printers.</li>
        <li>When your printer appears in the list, click <strong>Add device</strong> next to its name. Windows will automatically install the necessary drivers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Print a Test Page</h3>
      <p>Once the printer is added, it's a good idea to print a test page to make sure everything is working.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Printers & scanners</strong> settings, click on your new printer.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Printer properties</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the new window, look for a button that says <strong>Print Test Page</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the page prints successfully, you're all set!</p>

      <p><strong>✅ Tip for Students:</strong> For extra features like scanning or checking ink levels, it's often best to go to the printer manufacturer's website (e.g., epson.com/support) and download the full software package for your specific printer model. This gives you more control than the basic drivers Windows installs.</p>
